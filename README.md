# Airbnb Listings and Reviews: An Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Summary
This initiative undertakes a deep exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb Listings & Reviews to uncover pivotal insights into what influences listing prices, delineate the attributes of listings, and provide a comprehensive overview of the Airbnb market dynamics.

## Dataset Overview
This rich dataset comprises an extensive range of features concerning Airbnb listings, including aspects like the physical attributes of accommodations, host-related information, pricing dynamics, availability, and detailed guest reviews. The data encapsulates a variety of cities, showcasing a wide spectrum of accommodation types.

## Analysis Highlights
The EDA focuses on several key aspects:
- Investigating the effect of room types on pricing.
- Analyzing price distribution and approaches to its normalization.
- Exploring correlations between listing characteristics, particularly in relation to price.
- Identifying and examining outliers within the dataset.
- Review scores and their connection to listing features.

## Principal Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:
- Room type is a significant factor affecting listing prices.
- Price distribution exhibits right skewness, with log transformation serving as an effective normalization technique.
- Positive correlations were observed between listing price and factors such as guest capacity, number of bedrooms, and location-centric review scores.
- Outliers detected in the dataset could represent luxury accommodations or be indicative of data entry inaccuracies.
